# Intro

The library is a prototype to test and validate approach and architecture for of
direct access to dxfeed's CometD interface over websocket.

The reason behind of that is that the target platform is not supported
by any of provided dxFeed Client APIs.

## What do you need to play with that

1) You need an URL to access point
2) You need to have access to access token
